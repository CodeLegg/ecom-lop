## Design  

### Colour Scheme

Initial colour scheme is general light theme for a contemporary look, I have included platinum/grey & orange as accent colours which will also provide good accessibility scores.  

![alt text](static/readmeimages/color-scheme.png "Colour Scheme")



### Typography

The font used throughout the site is 'Poppins', I have chosen this font because I consider it to be clean and easy to read.  

### Layout

The layout of the LotsofPresents website is built using custom css and js, which provides full customabilty that allows the website to look unique and different to the same old style, i also used media quries to allow it to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.   

### Accessibility  

I ran the site through a wave validator to ensure there were no accessibility errors. There is one contrast error but i find this to minor as its the color of my theme, all forms have labels or aria labels and images have alts.
 

### Imagery  
Used a combination of imagery from different websites as i found it hard to find good free images. Images are all of a similar size and quality for consistency throughout the site.

### Wireframes![LotsOfPresents Wireframe](static/readmeimages/wireframe.png "project wireframe")
There have been some changes since the wireframe was created. 

### Data Model  
![Store](static/readmeimages/store-schema.png)
![Payment](static/readmeimages/payment-schema.png) 

The following datbase models were used;  
Orders -  used to store users oreder information.  
Order line items -  used to handle order infromation in basket.  
Products -  Used to add information about products on site.  
Users -  Used in user registration.  
Contacts -  Used for customer contact form.  
Profiles -  Used to enable users to access order history and update default deilvery information.  
Reviews -  Used for users to add reviews on the site.  

### Security    

A number of different security considerations were taken into account when putting together this project.    

**Use of .env file**  
Important credentials including DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE keys, AWS ACCESS KEYS and GMAIL passwords are located within .env file which is subsequently in a .gitignore file to ensure it remains secure. SECRET_KEY was initially located in settings.py file, it has since been changed and moved to a more secure location in .env file, the database was also subsequently destroyed and rebuilt to produce a different DATABASE_URL.  

**Defensive Programming**  
Measures have been put in place throughout the site to prevent users from doing things they are not authorised to do. For example, Users can only access the product admin panel if they are superusers. Users can not access the profile page unless they are authenticated and can also not add reviews.  

**Feedback to Users**  
Toast messages provide feedback to users about the status of their actions. For example, 'successful login or reasons for authentication failure'.

**Cart**  
The basket allows users to view items in their basket. They can see all aspects of there order. I have included a 'view embroidery text' modal because when there was large amount of text, it was difficult to handle on the one page.

Users can navigate to respective social media sites that are present in the footer. On non-touchscreen devices, an animation has been added causing the icons to rotate utilising SVG.  

 ![footer](static/readmeimages/footer.png)

Toast messages have been added to prompt users when siginificant actions are taken on the site such as adding to bag, adding review, registering and logging in. Toast messages have also been set up to handle errors.  


### Future Implementations

- Q & A on products
- More Products & Categories
